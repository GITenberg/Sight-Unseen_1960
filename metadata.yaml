description: Mary Roberts Rinehart rose to literary acclaim as a mystery writer and
  eventually became known as the ""American Agatha Christie."" In Sight Unseen, Rinehart
  strays somewhat from the formula that made her famous, incorporating supernatural
  elements into the mystery at the heart of the novel. If you're looking for a fast-paced
  read that will send shivers down your spine, put Sight Unseen on your must-read
  list.
